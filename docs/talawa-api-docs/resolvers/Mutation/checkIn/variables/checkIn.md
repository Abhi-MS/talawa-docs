This resolver function allows event admins or superadmins to check-in attendees for a specific event.
It verifies the existence of the current user, the event, and the attendee to be checked in,
and ensures proper authorization before performing the check-in operation.

The check-in data if successful.

## Throws

NotFoundError if the current user, event, or attendee is not found.

## Throws

UnauthorizedError if the current user lacks authorization to perform the check-in operation.

## Throws

ConflictError if the attendee is already checked in for the event.

## Remarks

The function performs the following checks and operations:
1. Verifies the existence of the current user, event, and attendee.
2. Checks if the current user is authorized to perform the check-in operation.
3. Checks if the attendee is already registered for the event. If so, updates the check-in status and isCheckedIn.
4. Checks if the attendee is not already checked in for the event then creates a new check-in entry and create new eventAttendee with chechInId and isCheckedIn.
