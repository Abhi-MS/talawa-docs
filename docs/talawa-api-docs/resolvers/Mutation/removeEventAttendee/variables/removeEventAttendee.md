# Variable: removeEventAttendee

\> `const` **removeEventAttendee**: [`MutationResolvers`](../../../../types/generatedGraphQLTypes/type-aliases/MutationResolvers.md)\[`"removeEventAttendee"`\]

Removes a user from the list of attendees for a specific event.

This function manages the removal of an event attendee by first verifying
the current user's authorization and the existence of the event. It checks
if the user making the request is either a super admin or an admin of the event,
and if the user to be removed is indeed registered as an attendee for the event.
If all checks pass, the user is removed from the event's attendee list.

## Param

## Param
