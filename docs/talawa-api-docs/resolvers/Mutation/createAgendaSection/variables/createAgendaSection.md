# Variable: createAgendaSection

\> `const` **createAgendaSection**: [`MutationResolvers`](../../../../types/generatedGraphQLTypes/type-aliases/MutationResolvers.md)\[`"createAgendaSection"`\]

Creates a new agenda section and performs authorization checks.

This resolver performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the current user based on the userId from the context.
2. Fetches the associated app user profile for the current user.
3. Validates the existence of the related event and checks user permissions.
4. Creates a new agenda section and sets the appropriate metadata.

## Param

  - `input`: An object containing:
    - `relatedEvent`: The ID of the event to which the new agenda section is related.
    - Additional fields for the agenda section.

## Param
