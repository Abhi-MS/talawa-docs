# Variable: blockUser

\> `const` **blockUser**: [`MutationResolvers`](../../../../types/generatedGraphQLTypes/type-aliases/MutationResolvers.md)\[`"blockUser"`\]

Mutation resolver function to block a user from an organization.

This function performs the following actions:
1. Verifies that the organization specified by `args.organizationId` exists.
2. Ensures that the user specified by `args.userId` exists.
3. Checks if the user attempting to block the user is an admin of the organization.
4. Verifies if the user to be blocked is currently a member of the organization.
5. Ensures that the user is not attempting to block themselves.
6. Blocks the user by adding them to the organization's `blockedUsers` list and removing them from the `members` list.
7. Updates the user's document to reflect that they have been blocked by the organization, and removes the organization from their `joinedOrganizations` list.
