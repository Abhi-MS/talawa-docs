# Variable: createActionItem

\> `const` **createActionItem**: [`MutationResolvers`](../../../../types/generatedGraphQLTypes/type-aliases/MutationResolvers.md)\[`"createActionItem"`\]

This function performs several checks:

1. Verifies if the current user exists.
2. Ensures that the current user has an associated app user profile.
3. Checks if the assignee exists.
4. Validates if the action item category exists and is not disabled.
5. Confirms that the assignee is a member of the organization associated with the action item category.
6. If the action item is related to an event, checks if the event exists and whether the current user is an admin of that event.
7. Verifies if the current user is an admin of the organization or a superadmin.
