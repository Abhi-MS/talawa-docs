Talawa helps community based organizations collaborate with their membership.

## Community Based Organizations

What do we mean by community based organizations? These are groups of people participating in a common social cause for the benefit of their local communities mostly through volunteers. These include:

1. open source software projects;
2. non-profit charities;
3. social groups;
4. and in limited cases, businesses.

If your organization is making a meaningful difference to your community then Talawa could be for you.

## Talawa Features

Talawa is in a pre-release state. We plan to create a demonstrable minimally viable product (MVP) in 2023 for alpha testing.

Key features include:

| Multi-Organizational | Organizations that serve multiple neighborhoods or cities can easily be managed by local leaders through our admin portal.       | Have the peace of mind knowing that you can delegate many Talawa organizational tasks to others. Now you can focus on areas of greater priority.                                     |
| Plugin support       | Talawa isn't an isolated system. It allows you to interact with the service providers you need to run an efficient organization. | You don't have to worry about using another service, with the right plugin, Talawa will be able to talk to it just fine.                                                             |

We are always thinking of adding more features. Let us know what you'd like to see.

Talawa has three main components. A mobile application with social media features, a web based portal to be used by the organization’s administrative team, and finally an API providing access to data and features.
​​
The Palisadoes Foundation wants to eventually host Talawa as a cloud service to help finance its education outreach.
